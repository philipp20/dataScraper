# dataScraper
### Description:
Python script that scrapes data from a local html file and outputs the scraped data into an excel (csv) file <br>

### Future Improvements:
* Dynamic html file to be scraped.
* Directly downloads the html page from the URL provided. <br>
  Challenge: Some websites have anti-bot protection that restricts automation scripts from accesing it.

### Sample output:
